#The title of this activity
title:
  Use short checklists of security principles

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  You get basic security practices right in your software design.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Use basic security principles

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  During design, technical staff on the project team use a short checklist of security principles. Typically, security principles include defense in depth, securing the weakest link, use of secure defaults, simplicity in design of security functionality, secure failure, balance of security and usability, running with least privilege, avoidance of security by obscurity, etc.

  For perimeter interfaces, the design team considers each principle in the context of the overall system and identify features that can be added to bolster security at each such interface. Limit these such that they only take a small amount of extra effort beyond the normal implementation cost of functional requirements. Note anything larger and schedule it for future releases.

  Train each project team with security awareness before this process, and incorporate more security-savvy staff to aid in making design decisions.
