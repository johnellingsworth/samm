#The title of this activity
title:
  Inventory and evaluate security quality of technologies, tools and frameworks used by applications.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity

  Risky technologies are identified and replaced

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Elicit technologies, frameworks and integrations within the overall solution

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  People often take the path of least resistance in developing, deploying or operating a software solution. New technologies are included when they can facilitate or speed up the effort or enable the solution to scale better. These new technologies might, however, introduce new risks to the organisation that you need to manage.

  Identify the most important technologies, frameworks, tools and integrations being used for each application. Use the solution architectâ€™s knowledge, or study the development and operating environment and artefacts. Then evaluate them for their security quality and raise important issues (LINK TO defect management).
