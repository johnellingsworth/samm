#The title of this activity
title:
  Specific security requirements are utilized during product development.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  You have specified relevant security requirements in a structured format.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Structured requirements engineering

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Security requirements can originate from other sources including policies and legislation, known problems in the application, and intelligence from metrics and feedback (LINK to DM lvl 3). At this level, a more systematic elicitation of security requirements must be achieved by analysing different sources of such requirements. Ensure that appropriate input is received from these sources to help the elicitation of requirements. For example, organize interviews or brainstorm sessions (e.g., in the case of policy and legislation), analyse historical logs or vulnerability systems.

  Use a structured notation of security requirements across applications and an appropriate formalism that integrates well with how you specify other (functional) requirements for the project. This could mean, for example, extending analysis documents, writing user stories, etc.

  When requirements are specified, it is important to ensure that these requirements are taken into account during product development. Setup a mechanism to stimulate or force project teams to meet these requirements in the product. For example, annotate requirements with priorities, or influence the handling of requirements to enforce sufficient security appetite (while balancing against other non-functional requirements).
