#The title of this activity
title:
  Proactively engage with software suppliers on methodology, tools and security objectives.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  You align software development practices to limit security risks.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Ensure proper coverage for external suppliers

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The best way to minimize the risk of issues in software is to align maximally and integrate closely between the different parties. From a process perspective, this means using similar development paradigms and introducing regular milestones to ensure proper alignment and qualitative progress. From a tools perspective, this might mean using similar build, verification and deployment environments, and sharing other supporting tools (e.g. requirements or architecture tools, or code repositories).

  In case suppliers cannot meet the objectives that you have set, implement compensating controls so that, overall, you meet your objectives. Execute extra activities (e.g., threat modelling before starting the actual implementation cycle) or implement extra tooling (e.g., 3rd party library analysis at solution intake). The more suppliers deviate from your requirements, the more work will be required to compensate.
