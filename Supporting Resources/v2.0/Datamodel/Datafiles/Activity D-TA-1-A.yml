longDescription: 
  As an organization, you want to spend your security budget where it matters. Application risk is a good tool to guide your security spending. A risk classification helps identify which applications can pose a serious threat to the organization if they were attacked or breached.

  Use a simple method to evaluate the application risk per application, estimating the potential business impact that it poses for the organization in case of an attack. To achieve this, evaluate the impact of a breach in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data or service. Consider using a set of 5-10 questions to understand important application characteristics, such as whether the application processes financial data, whether it is internet facing, or whether privacy-related data is involved. The application risk profile tells you whether these factors are applicable and if they could significatly impact the organization.

  Next, use a scheme to classify applications according to this risk. A simple, qualitative scheme (e.g. high/medium/low) that translates these characteristics into a value is often effective. It is important to use these values to represent and compare the risk of different applications against each other. Mature highly risk-driven organizations might make use of more quantitative risk schemes. Donâ€™t invent a new risk scheme if your organization already has one that works well.

  Evaluate the risk based on the set of questions and assign a risk level to each application.
