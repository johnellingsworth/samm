#The title of this activity
title:
  Perform basic threat modeling to understand risks in application design.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Basic understanding of potential threats to the solution.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Best effort ad-hoc threat modeling

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The purpose of Threat Modeling is to pro-actively identify potential issues in the technical design of the application. A careless setup might lead to important attack vectors in an application that can be exploited to target your organization. Experience shows that architectural design can be an important source of security issues, and the consequences can be significant.

  The practice of threat modeling includes both eliciting and managing threats. Use known good security practices (or the lack thereof) or a more structured approach such as STRIDE to elicit threats. Threat modeling is often most effective when performed by a group of people, allowing for brainstorming. One of the key challenges in threat modeling is working towards a list of relevant and important threats in an efficient exercise, and avoiding lengthy processes and overly detailed lists of low-relevant threats. Experience helps find a proper balance.

  Perform threat modeling iteratively to align to more iterative development paradigms. If you add new functionality to an existing application, look only into the newly added functions instead of trying to cover the entire scope.

  Execute threat modeling on important projects (LINK Application Risk Profile) in a best effort mode to identify the most important threats to the application. Existing network diagrams you can annotate during discussion workshops are a good starting point.
