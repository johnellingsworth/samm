#The title of this activity
title:
  Software teams continuously evaluate application risk profile and update based upon evolving business decisions. 

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Timely update of the application classification in case of changes.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Periodically review application risk profiles

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The application portfolio of an organization changes, as well as the conditions and constraints in which an application lives (e.g., driven by the company strategy). Periodically review the risk inventory to ensure correctness of the risk evaluations of the different applications.

  Have a periodic review at an enterprise-wide level. Also, as your enterprise matures in software assurance, stimulate teams to continuously question which changes in conditions might impact the risk profile. For instance, an internal application might become exposed to the internet by a business decision. This should trigger the teams to rerun the risk evaluation and update the application risk profile accordingly.

  In a mature implementation of this practice, train and continuously update teams on lessons learned and best practices from these risk evaluations. This leads to a better execution and a more accurate representation of the application risk profile.
