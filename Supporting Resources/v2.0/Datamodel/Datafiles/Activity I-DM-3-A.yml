#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  An individual or team outside of those responsible for developing and deploying the software (e.g. an information security officer) is responsible for managing known defects and enforcing the defined threshold.

  Defects that exceed the threshold block or prevent deployment into production, until they are resolved, or fall below the threshold. You can do this automatically in the build and deployment processes, if they are integrated with the defect management system. Alternatively, the deployment process could include a step that requires approval from an information security officer.

  Keep a list of known defects, with accurate risk rating and categorisations over time (e.g. in-line with new research and changing opinions within the industry, and improving capabilities of some adversaries).

  This includes managing lists of defects that have been accepted, mitigated, or marked as a false positives. Review the status of accepted and mitigated risks periodically (e.g. to identify a defect that now poses a greater risk because a mitigating control has been changed or removed).
