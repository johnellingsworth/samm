#The title of this activity
title:
  Use trend analysis to influence changes in the Design and Implementation phase across multiple projects.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Defect metrics are enriched with real time information and correlated to detect trends and influence the overall security strategy.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Add information to defects, such as:

  * Category
  * CVE / CWE
  * Software component
  * Business unit
  * Exploitability
  * Impact
  * Risk
  * CVSS

  For each defect, up-to-date or real-time data on the availability of exploits and hacker activity in the wild is used to contribute to risk scores.

  Different metrics and fields are combined to look for trends. Trends across various timespans are identified through graphs and dashboarding. Trends are analysed and the results are used to influence the design and implementation of software and the overall security stategy.

  Metrics are used to empower the whole organisation. People and teams all receive the correct information that is relevant to their role(s). Tasks are assigned appropriately and sometimes automatically.
