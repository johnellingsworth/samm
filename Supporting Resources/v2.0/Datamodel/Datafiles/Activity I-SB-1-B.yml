#The title of this activity
title:
  All application dependencies are identified and documented.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  You know which production components are at risk from a known vulnerable 3rd party dependencies. Dependencies include 3rd party software dependencies and operating system dependencies. 3rd party dependencies often inculde more dependencies (called transitive dependencies).

#A one sentence description of the activity

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Keep a record of all dependencies used throughout the target production environment. This is sometimes referred to as a Bill of Materials (BOM). In building these records, consider the various locations where dependencies might be specified:

  - configuration files 
  - the project's directory on disk
  - package management tool
  - code (e.g. via an IDE that supports listing dependencies)

  Consider that the different dependencies and aspects of the application may consume entirely different dependencies. For example, if the software package is a web app, cover both the server-side application code and client-side scripts.

  The records include the following information about each dependency:

  * Where it is used or referenced
  * Why it is required
  * Version used
  * License
  * Source information (link to repository, author's name, etc.)
  * Open source or proprietary
  * Support and maintenance status of the dependency

  Check the records, whenever practical, to discover any dependencies with known vulnerabilities and update or replace them accordingly.

  Ensure that providers actively maintain dependencies, and that they deal with security vulnerabilities appropriately. Gain assurance when dealing with open source dependencies, either through agreements with a commercial vendor, or other means, for example, by looking at repository activity, and the developers' responses to security issues raised by the community.
