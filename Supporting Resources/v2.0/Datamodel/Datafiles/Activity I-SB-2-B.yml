#The title of this activity
title:
  All components and dependencies are periodically reviewed for known security vulnerabilities and licensing issues.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  There is an audit trail of all 3rd party dependencies used in development and you know and track their security status at any given time.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Evaluate dependencies to establish a whitelist of acceptable code dependencies approved for use within a project, team, or the wider organization.

  Alternatively, introduce a central repository of approved dependencies that all software must be built from.

  Review dependencies regularly to ensure that: 
  
  * they remain correctly licensed
  * no known and significant vulnerabilities are present
  * there is support and active maintenance for the dependency
  * there is a good business reason to include the dependency

  You may need tools to automate some or all of this process, such as analyzing where the dependency is used, or checking for updates via a package manager. Consider using an automated tool to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
