#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Perform verification tests against dependencies in the same way you do against the target application. Refer to Verification > Security Testing. Depending on the build process maturity level, the discovery of significant issues might cause the build to fail.

  Log results centrally, triage and validate findings appropriately as described in Implementation > Defect Management. Vulnerable dependencies should be blacklisted and not permitted to be used during builds. Feed findings back to the vendor or open source project, following a set of ethical disclosure guidelines.
