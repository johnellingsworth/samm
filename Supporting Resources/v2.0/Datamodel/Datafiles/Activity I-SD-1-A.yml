#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Deploy applications via automated processes, or manually by people other than the developers. Developers do not have access to production environments.

  Choose any tools used during deployment carefully and harden them appropriately. If these tools require access to the production environment, their security is extremely critical. Ensure the integrity of the tools themselves and the workflows they follow.

  Handle access to the production credentials and secrets for the tools and engineer conducting the deployment with care - e.g. according to the principle of least privilege, and encrypted at rest with keys held in a trusted platform module (TPM) or hardware security module (HSM).

  People with access to production have to go through a minimum level of training or certification to ensure competency in this sensitive environment. Refer to Governance > Education & Guidance.
