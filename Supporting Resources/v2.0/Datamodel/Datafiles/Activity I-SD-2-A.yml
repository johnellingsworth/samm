#The title of this activity
title:
  Integration of security verification in deployment (e.g. binary static code analysis / AV scan).

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  The deployment process is fully or partially automated and can be halted based on the results of integrated security verification tests.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Fully or partially automate deployment to reduce the need for manual changes on production, and to reduce the chances of human error.

  Deployments include appropriate automated security checks such as DAST and malware scanning. Notify relevant people of any defects automatically. Stop or reverse the deployment automatically, or as part of a manual approval workflow, if the defect exceeds a certain threshold of severity or risk. Log the results from these tests centrally and take any necessary actions.

  Account for and audit all deployments. Have a system in place to record each deployment, including information about who conducted it, the software version that was deployed, and any relevant variables specific to the deploy.
