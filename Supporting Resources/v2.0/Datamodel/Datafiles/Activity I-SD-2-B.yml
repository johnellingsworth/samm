#The title of this activity
title:
  Secrets are dynamically included during the deployment process.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Secrets are dynamically extracted from the digital vault for use in deployment.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Have an automated process to add credentials and secrets appropriate for the target environment to configuration files during the deployment process. This way, developers and deployers do not see or handle those sensitive values.

  Make the system used to store and process the secrets and credentials robust from a security perspective. Encrypt secrets at rest and during transport. Users who configure this system and the secrets it contains are subject to the principle of least privilege. For example, a developer might need to manage the secrets for a development environment, but not a user acceptence test or production environment.
