#The title of this activity
title:
  Integrity of the code is verified prior to deployment.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  The deployment process automatically validates the integrity of its artifacts.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The deployment process automatically verifies the integrity of the binaries by checking their signatures against trusted certificates. Sign binaries at build time. This may include binaries developed and built in-house, as well as third-party libraries. Do not deploy binary signatures that cannot be verified, including those with invalid or expired certificates.

  If the list of trusted certificates includes third-party developers, check them periodically, and keep them in line with the organisationâ€™s wider governance surrounding trusted third-party suppliers.

  Manually approve the deployment at least once during an automated deployment. Whenever a human check is significantly more accurate than an automated one during the deployment process, do it manually.
