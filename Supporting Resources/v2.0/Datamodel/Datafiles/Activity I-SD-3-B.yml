#The title of this activity
title:
  Files and repositories are checked periodically for secrets that should be protected.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Secrets are dynamically generated during deployment and a process routinely checks for and mitigates unprotected secrets.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Where secrets are not predefined or dependant on another system, generate them during the deployment process. Follow appropriate best practices such as using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator if you generate this value randomly.

  Implement checks that detect the presence of secrets in code repositories and files, and run them periodically. Configure tools to look for known strings and unknown high entropy strings, for instance. In systems such as code repositories, where there is a history, include the versions in the checks.

  Mark potential secrets you discover as sensitive values, and either remove them or render them non-sensitive. If you cannot remove them, from a historic file in a code repository, for example, you may need to refresh the value on the system that consumes the secret. This way, if an attacker discovers the secret, it will not be useful to them.
