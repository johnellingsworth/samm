#The title of this activity
title:
  Prioritized best-effort patching

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Mitigated prominent issues in third-party code

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform best-effort patching of system and application components.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Identify applications and third-party application components which need to be updated or patched, including the underlying operating system, application server or third-party code library.

  Carry out patching activities according to best-effort. However, define the update process at least on a high level (e.g., testing the patches don't break anything). Use opportunities like maintenance windows for best-effort patching.

  Share knowledge of the patching process for components. Teams cooperate if necessary. You can carry out patching anytime in case of need (e.g., exploit for a third-party component publicly available).

  You can find out the versions of all components in use to evaluate whether you are affected by a particular public security vulnerability.
