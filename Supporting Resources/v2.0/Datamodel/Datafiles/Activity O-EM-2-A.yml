#The title of this activity
title:
  Hardening baseline and guidelines available

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Better efficiency due to established baselines

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform consistent hardening of configurations, following established baselines and guidance.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Within the scope relevant for this activity, define hardening baselines for particular components. The affected teams know and acknowledge them. This typically leads to a standard way of deploying the affected components over the organization.

  The baselines have an owner responsible for keeping them up to date (e.g., if new best practices or features are available with new versions) and adapting them according to trustworthy sources. Both new and existing systems are part of the hardening process.

  In larger environments, derive configuration of all instances from your own master, where there is already common ground work. Consider using automated tools for hardening configuration.
