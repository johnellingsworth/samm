#The title of this activity
title:
  Formal process covering the full stack

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Reliable handling of third-party code issues

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform regularly scheduled patching of system and application components, across the full stack.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Define and document the update process across the full stack. You don't rely on available patches provided by vendors only; you use external sources systematically to gather intelligence about zero day vulnerabilities, and take appropriate risk mitigation steps.

  There is a guidance for prioritization of particular updates, including concerns important to your organization like the criticality of the application, or severity of security issues. Schedule updates (without necessary relevancy to known issues), e.g. using a patch/upgrade calendar of vendors.

  If there is a known critical issue while the patch is not available yet, triage and handle this issue (e.g., by finding workarounds, monitoring measures, or even switching off the affected applications).
