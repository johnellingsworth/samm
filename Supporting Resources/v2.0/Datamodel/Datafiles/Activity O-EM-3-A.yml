#The title of this activity
title:
  Detection and handling of non-conformities

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Profound knowledge about state of hardening measures across the organization

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Actively monitor configurations for non-conformance to baselines, and handle detected occurrences as security defects.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Track and evaluate conformity with the hardening baselines. Triage and handle nonconformities as security findings according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice. Automated measures ensuring self-healing of critical configuration mistakes and alerting relevant stakeholders are in place if sensible.

  Verify the validity of the current hardening baselines in the component update process. Incorporate relevant changes in the baselines and in the auditing measures.

  Periodically audit the continuous improvement process for the baselines and act upon the resulting findings.
