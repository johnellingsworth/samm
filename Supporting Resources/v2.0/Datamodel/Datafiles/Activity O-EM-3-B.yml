shortDescription:
  Proactively monitor update status and manage missing updates as security defects.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  You have very good insight (e.g., through a dashboard) of the patching strategy across the organization and full stack. You triage and handle missing updates according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice. It is guaranteed that patching can take place anytime so that SLAs can be adhered to.

  If there are applications with worse patch level, the situation is analyzed and corrective actions are performed if reasonable.
