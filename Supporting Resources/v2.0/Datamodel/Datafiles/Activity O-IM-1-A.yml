#The title of this activity
title:
  Best-effort incident detection with available log data

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Ability to detect the most obvious security incidents within a reasonable timeframe

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Use available log data to perform best-effort detection of possible security incidents.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  Available log data (e.g., access logs, application logs, infrastructure logs) are analyzed to detect possible security incidents in accordance with known log data retention periods.

  In small setups, you can do this manually with the help of common command-line tools. With larger log volumes, employ automation techniques--even a cron job running simple script, looking for suspicious events, is a step forward! 

  If logs from different sources are sent to a dedicated log aggregation system, it might be a good idea to analyze the logs there and employ basic log correlation principles.

  Even if you don''t have a 24/7 incident detection process, unavailability of the responsible person (e.g., due to vacation or illness) shouldn''t impact the detection speed and quality significantly.

  You have a defined and generally known contact point for formal creation of security incidents.
