longDescription: 
  The first step is to recognize the incident response competence as such and define a responsible owner. They keep up with current state of incident handling best practices and forensic tooling.

  You don''t mandate dedicated incident response personnel on this maturity level, but you have defined the participants of the process (usually different roles). There is a known single point of contact for the process and a conscious decision regarding reachability of the participants.

  When security incidents happen, you document the steps taken. Protect this information from unauthorized access, as necessary.
