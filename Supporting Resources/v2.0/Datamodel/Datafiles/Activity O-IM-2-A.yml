#The title of this activity
title:
  Automated log evaluation driven by process

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Ability to timely detect expected security incidents

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Follow an established, well-documented process for automated log evaluation.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription:
  The incident detection process has a dedicated owner and clear documentation accessible to all process stakeholders, and is periodically checked to make sure it is up to date. You ensure employees responsible for incident detection follow this process (e.g., using training).

  The process typically relies on a high degree of automation, collecting and correlating log data from different sources including application logs. You may collect the logs to a central place, if suitable. Explicit attention is periodically paid to integrity of the analyzed data. If you add a new application, you ensure that the process covers it within reasonable period of time.

  You detect possible security incidents according to an available checklist. The checklist covers expected attack vectors, and known or expected kill chains. You evaluate it and update it regularly.

  If you evaluate an event as a security incident with high level of confidence, the responsible staff is notified immediately, even outside business hours. You perform further analysis and start the escalation process.
