  Formally establish and document the security incident response process. The documentation includes information like:
  - Most probable/common scenarios of security incidents and high-level instructions for handling them. For such scenarios, also use public knowledge about possibly relevant third-party incidents
  - Rules for triaging each incident
  - Rules for involvement of different stakeholders (including mandatory timeframe to do so, if needed), including senior management, Public Relations, Legal, privacy, Human Resources, external (law enforcement) authorities, and customers.

  Knowledgeable and properly trained staff is available in and outside of business hours with defined time to act. Keep both hardware and software tools up to date and ready for use anytime. Define a war room.

  The process includes a policy for carrying out root cause analysis and its expected outcomes.
