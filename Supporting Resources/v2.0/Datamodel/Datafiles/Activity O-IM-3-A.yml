#The title of this activity
title:
  Reliable timely incident detection

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Ability to timely detect unexpected security incidents

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Use a proactively managed process for detection of incidents.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  The process documentation includes measures for continuous process improvement. You check the continuity of process improvement (e.g., via tracking of changes).

  The checklist for suspicious event detection is correlated at least from:
  - Sources and knowledge bases external to the company (e.g., new vulnerability announcements affecting the used technologies)
  - Past security incidents
  - Threat model outcomes

  You use correlation of logs for incident detection for all reasonable incident scenarios. If the log data for incident detection is not available, you document it as a defect, triage and handle it according to the resulting priority / SLA.

  The quality of the incident detection does not depend on the time or day of the event. If you do not act upon the security event within a defined time, it triggers further notifications according to a defined escalation path. The efficiency is of the incident is also checked by exercises with defined improvement action points.
