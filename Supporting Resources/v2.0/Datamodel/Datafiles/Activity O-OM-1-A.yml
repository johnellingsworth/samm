#The title of this activity
title:
  Basic data protections in place

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Sensitive data are protected from accidental disclosure

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Implement basic data protection practices

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The organization understands the types and sensitivity of data stored and processed by applications, and maintains awareness of the fate of processed data (e.g., backups, sharing with external partners). At this level of maturity, the information gathered may be captured in varying forms and different places; no organization-wide data catalog is assumed to exist. The organization protects and handles all data associated with a given application according to protection requirements applying to the most sensitive data stored and processed.

  The organization implements basic controls, to prevent propagation of unsanitized sensitive data from production environments to lower environments. By ensuring unsanitized production data are never propagated to lower (non-production) environments, the organization can focus data protection policies and activities on production.
