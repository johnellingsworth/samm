#The title of this activity
title:
  Decomissioning and legacy migration processes in place

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: |
  - Reduced attack surface, through elimination of unused configuration in operating environments
  - Elimination of risks associated with end-of-life software

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Develop repeatable processes for decomissioning unused systems and services, and for migrating away from legacy third-party dependencies. Manage legacy migration roadmaps for customers.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  As part of decommissioning a system, application, or service, the organization follows an established process for removing all relevant accounts, firewall rules, data, etc. from the operational environment. By removing these unused elements from configuration files, the organization improves the maintainability of its infrastructure-as-code resources.

  The organization follows a consistent process for timely replacement or upgrade of third-party applications, or application dependencies (e.g., operating system, utility applications, libraries), that have reached end of life.

  The organization engages with customers and user groups for its products at or approaching end of life, to migrate them to supported versions in a timely manner.
