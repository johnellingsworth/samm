#The title of this activity
title:
  Proactive reliable handling of legacy applications/services

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: |
  - Reduced risks, through eliminating unsupported applications and libraries from operating environments
  - Minimized product support burden

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Proactively manage migration roadmaps, for both unsupported end-of-life dependencies, and legacy versions of delivered software.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The organization regularly evaluates the lifecycle state and support status of every software asset and underlying infrastructure component, and estimates their end-of-life. The organization follows a well-defined process for actively mitigating security risks arising as assets/components approach their end-of-life. The organization regularly reviews and updates its process, to reflect lessons learned. 

  The organization has established a product support plan, providing clear timelines for ending support on older product versions. Product versions in active use are limited to only a small number (e.g., N.x.x and N-1.x.x only). The organization establishes and publicizes timelines for discontinuing support on prior versions, and proactively engages with customers and user groups to prevent disruption of service or support.
