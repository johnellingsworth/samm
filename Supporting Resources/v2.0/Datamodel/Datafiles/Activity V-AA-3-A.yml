#The title of this activity
title:
  Review and eveluate security mechanisms for scalability, strategic alignment and support capabilities and log findings. 

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Assurance on the effectiveness of the architecture security mechanisms in terms of strategy alignment, appropriate support, and scalability.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Review of the architecture components effectiveness

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Review the effectiveness of the architecture components. Are the architecture security mechanisms well implemented? For each of the application and infrastructure components, review their effectiveness to secure the application.

  Evaluate effectiveness for the security mechanisms provided by the components in terms of identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery of security or privacy issues. Review their effectiveness in terms of strategy alignment, appropriate support, and scalability. Feed any findings back into the Security Architecture practice.
