#The title of this activity
title:
  Security controls are verified using security test cases, with minimal vulnerabilities.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Verifies that the standard software security controls operate as expected.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Test for software security controls

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Conduct security tests to verify that the standard software security controls operate as expected. At a high level, this means testing the correct functioning of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls of the data as well as the service. Security test cases at least include testing for authentication, access control, input validation, encoding, and escaping data and encryption controls. The test objective is to validate that the security controls are implemented with few or no vulnerabilities.

  The security testing tests for software security controls that are relevant for the software under test. Perform control verification security tests manually or with tools each time the application changes its use of the controls. Software control verification is mandatory for all software that is part of the SAMM program. Review the tests regularly to include changes in the software technology and vulnerability trends.
