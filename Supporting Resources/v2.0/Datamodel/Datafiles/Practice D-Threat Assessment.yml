#A multi-paragraph description of the security practice
longDescription:
  The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on accurately identifying and understanding potential attacks upon an organization''s software to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management. Indeed, software assurance is all about identifying risks in applications and treating them accordingly.

  Risks to an application can be relative to the business of the application (think about business logic attacks) or to the technical setup of the application. The Application Risk Profile stream deals with the former, while the Threat Modeling focuses on the latter.
