#A multi-paragraph description of the security practice
longDescription: |
  Once your applications become operational, you''re likely to face security incidents. For this document, we consider a security incident a breach or threat of an imminent breach of at least one asset''s security goals due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include:
  - a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application; 
  - an application user accessing private data of another, by abusing a security vulnerability; or 
  - an attacker modifying application source code.

  Sometimes, a security incident is detected only after months, or even years, when damage has already been done. That''s why the first stream called Incident Detection addresses the ability to reliably and timely detect security incidents.

  Once you have identified that you''re suffering from a security incident, it''s essential to act in a well organized way in order to limit the damage as much as possible. Actitivies leading to this goal are described by the second stream called Incident Response.
