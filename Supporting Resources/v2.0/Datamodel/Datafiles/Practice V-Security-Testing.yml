#A one sentence description of the security practice
shortDescription:
  The development team detects and fixes basic security issues through automation, allowing manual testing to focus on more complex attack vectors.

#A multi-paragraph description of the security practice
longDescription:
  With manual and automated security tests, projects within the organization routinely run security tests and review results during development and deployment. They detect and fix basic security issues through scalable automation, where manual security testing focuses on more complex attack vectors with deeper understanding of the software.

  Project teams focus on buildout of granular (manual and automated) security test cases based on the business functionality of their software. A central software security group focuses on specification of automated tests for compliance and internal standards.

  For each project release, present results from automated and manual security tests to management and business stakeholders for review. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them. As part of each release, review and improve the quality of the security tests.

  Consider and implement security test correlation tools to automate the matching and merging of test results from dynamic, static, and interactive application scanners into one central dashboard, providing direct input towards Defect Management. Spread the knowledge of the created security tests and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organisation.
