#Multi-paragraph explanation of the stream
description: 
  This stream covers the time frame between a security-relevant event taking place and creation of a formal security incident (e.g., by creating a respective ticket and handing over to incident response process). With increasing maturity, you want to shorten this time span and detect security incidents more reliably and efficiently.
