#Multi-paragraph explanation of the stream
description: 
  From the perspective of the organization as a consumer of resources, the activities in this stream focus on the identification, management, and tracking of systems, applications, application dependencies, and services that are no longer used, have reached end of life, or are no longer actively developed or supported. Removal of unused systems and services improves manageability of the environment and reduces the organization''s attack surface, while affording direct and indirect cost savings (e.g., reduced license count, reduced logging volume, or reduced analyst effort).

  From the perspective of the organization as a supplier of software, activities in this stream focus on managing and reducing the organization''s support and maintenance workload, through the coordinated retirement of legacy software versions. Benefits to the organization can be significant over the long term, as a direct consequence of reducing the required back-porting effort for security-related fixes. These activities apply to all software resources developed by the organization, whether for internal use or for distribution to customers or users.
