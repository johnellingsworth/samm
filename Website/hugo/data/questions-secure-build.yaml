    quality_criteria:
        - Your build tools are hardened as per best practice and vendor guidance

    quality_criteria:
        - You have a maximum accepted severity for vulnerabilties
        - You log warnings and failures in a centralized system
        - Build processes prevent deployment to production when security checks fail
        - You select and configure tools to evaluate each application against its security requirements

- Do you evaluate security risk stemming from used dependencies?:

        - You can quickly find out which applications are affected by a particular CVE

    quality_criteria:
        - Dependencies are automatically evaluated for new CVEs
        - Above defined criticality threshold, responsible staff is alerted
        - License changes with possible impact on legal application usage are automatically detected and alerted
        - Usage of unmaintained dependencies is tracked and alerted

    quality_criteria:
        - Your build system is connected to a system for tracking 3rd party dependency risk, causing build to fail unless the vulnerability is evaluated to be a false positive or the risk is explicitely accepted.
        - You scan your dependencies using a static analysis tool
        - You report findings back to dependency authors using an established responsible disclosure process
        - Using a new dependency which has not been evaluated for security risk causes failing the build
